# Tapinator

> Note: Tapinator is currently under active development!

Tapintor is a web-based tap list that allows you to display your brews
on any web browser, including full-screen on a dedicated monitor. 

Tapinator has been built to run on a Raspberry Pi B, so it has very minimal
requirements.

## Installing Tapinator

Tapinator is easy-to-install using the `install.sh` script. Currently, 
running Tapintor itself is recommended on a Raspberry Pi device. 

## Editing your taps

Tapinator has two UIs for editing your tap list.

* A desktop client, supporting MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
* A mobile client
