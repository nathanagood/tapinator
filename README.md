# Tapinator

> Note: Tapinator is currently under active development!

Tapintor is a web-based tap list that allows you to display your brews on
any web browser, including full-screen on a dedicated monitor.

Tapinator has been built to run on a Raspberry Pi B, so it has very minimal
requirements.

## Installing Tapinator

Tapinator _will be, soon_ easy-to-install using the `install.sh`
script. Currently, installing running Tapintor itself is recommended on a
Raspberry Pi device.

## Editing your taps

Tapinator will have two UIs for editing your tap list.

* A desktop client, supporting MacOS, Windows, and Linux.  
* A mobile client (coming later)
